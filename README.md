# ohdsi-ares

Dockerization of the [OHDSI/Ares](https://github.com/OHDSI/Ares) application designed to monitor data quality across OMOP networks. This is the "front-end" application designed to work with data generated by [OHDSI/AresIndexer](https://github.com/OHDSI/AresIndexer) which we also publish in image form as [ohdsi-aresindexer](https://github.com/edencehealth/ohdsi-aresindexer).


## Usage

Some general notes:

* The is image is based on the [nginxinc/nginx-unprivileged:1-alpine](https://hub.docker.com/r/nginxinc/nginx-unprivileged) image, a publisher-verified image from NGINX, inc. which operates with reduced privileges.
* runs non-root: `uid=101(nginx) gid=101(nginx) groups=101(nginx)`
* the Ares app is installed in the document root `/usr/share/nginx/html`
* listens on port `8080`, can be used with a path-prefix of `/ares`
* Ares data should be mounted to the `/data` volume and placed at ``/data/ares`
* Ares data can be generated using the [ohdsi-aresindexer](https://github.com/edencehealth/ohdsi-aresindexer) image


To start the ARES container, you can run the following command:

```sh
docker run \
  --rm \
  --detach \
  --publish 8080:8080 \
  --volume "$(pwd)/data:/data" \
  edence/ohdsi-ares:latest
```
